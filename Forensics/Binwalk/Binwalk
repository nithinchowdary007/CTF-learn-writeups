Binwalk: Binwalk is a tool for searching a given binary image for embedded files and executable code. 
Specifically, it is designed for identifying files and code embedded inside of firmware images. 
Binwalk uses the libmagic library, so it is compatible with magic signatures created for the Unix file utility.
